## Introduction
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been a prominent player in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. In response, the managing director of Atliq Grands decided to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. Without an in-house data analytics team, they sought external expertise to analyze their historical data and provide actionable insights.
